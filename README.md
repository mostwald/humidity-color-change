# Abstract
Dynamic iridescence is one of the most striking visual displays in the animal kingdom. While reversible color changes are well-characterized in animal communication, more passive effects of climate on baseline coloration remain poorly understood. Here, we present a novel experimental demonstration of reversible, humidity-induced color change in bees. In controlled lab experiments, we show that relative humidity affects cuticle color of the sweat bee Agapostemon subtilior, changing dramatically within 24 hrs from a deep blue-green at low humidity to a pale, coppery green at high humidity. These color shifts are consistent with moisture-induced swelling of multilayer structures that causes reflection of longer wavelengths, a mechanism described in other insects and cephalopods. Older specimens experienced greater magnitude color shifts, suggesting that cuticular degradation increases water permeability. To understand whether these effects shape color variation in the wild, we extracted color data from a large dataset of crowd-sourced field images. We found that ambient humidity significantly predicts color variation (R/B ratio) across A. subtilior’s range, in a manner consistent with the direction of color change established in lab experiments. Together, these results reveal a previously unrecognized interaction between climate and structural coloration in bees, highlighting the role of abiotic conditions in shaping dynamic visual traits.
